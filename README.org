* pwd.sh
a simple password manager.

passwords are stored in hashed filenamed files, encrypted using a
gpg public key

pwd uses window titles or in case of firefox the current page url
for indexing keys, these are hashed with a salt for their final
directory name. Users are stored in separate files, similarily named
using hashed names underneath their respective "site" directory.
check out ~/.pwd after issuing a few "pwd.sh a" invocations.

for configuration check out the beginning of pwd.sh

importpwd imports passwords from the firefox password exporter addon.
all files are stored under ~/.pwd

bind to some window manager keys
pwd.sh      # for getting a password
pwd.sh a    # creating a new random password

if gpg fails on you, you should disable the gpg-agent for pwd.sh.

depends:
apt-get install gnupg xdotool xclip suckless-tools kdialog apg
